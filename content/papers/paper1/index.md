## TL;DR

If you don’t feel like reading this newsletter but want the code, here’s the link to my GitHub repository:  
👉 [**Disaggregated Price Stock Screener**](https://github.com/yourusername/Disaggregated-Price-Stock-Screener)

The code is well documented, but the last section of this post walks you through it step-by-step.

> — **Sir Isaac Newton (First Law of Motion)**

Newton probably hadn’t predicted this, but his first law of motion is just as prudent for solving a rigid-body physics problem as it is for addressing one of the hardest hurdles facing individual investors.

In pursuit of actively managing a personal portfolio, many individual investors get stuck at the **“getting the ball rolling”** step — finding what companies to perform due diligence on.  
This barrier to entry was one of the reasons **Jack Bogle** created the *Vanguard 500 Index Fund* — a passively managed mutual fund that tracks the S&P 500, giving investors diversification without excessive management fees.  
It’s also why passive funds’ AUM overtook that of actively managed funds at the end of 2023.

While there’s nothing wrong with being a passive investor (in fact, most people should be), I believe that individual investors would benefit from **some of the tools professional investors use** — one being the **stock screener**.

## Why Screeners Matter

The main purpose of a stock screener is to quickly filter out companies that don’t fit an investor’s criteria.  
For example, an investor might say:

> “I only want companies with ROIC > 15%, debt-to-equity < 0.4, buyback yield between 5–7.5%, and only in the mega-cap space.”

From this shortlist, they can perform deeper quantitative and fundamental analysis.

Shortlisting is fine — it gets investors started.  
However, once I had a shortlist, I found myself asking:  
**Which of these are actually worth researching further?**  
I wanted a **ranked screener based on value**, not just a filter.

## The Challenge

Like many retail investors, I don’t have access to Morningstar’s valuations or Bloomberg/FactSet screening tools.  
It’s just me and my Mac.

Recently, I tuned into an old episode of *Value Investing with Legends* featuring **Kim Shannon**, portfolio manager at Sionna Investment Managers.  
She’s used a quantitative screener since 1986 that involves letting *“price = price”* (timestamp 24:04).

What she really meant was:  
> *How does the current share price of a company compare to its disaggregated share price?*

This approach provides a **rough intrinsic value**, letting investors act quickly while identifying warning signs like high leverage or poor asset turnover.

---

## My Approach

Sionna’s screening tool is much more sophisticated, but conceptually we’re doing the same thing.

I **disaggregate price** by:

1. Obtaining a **two-year historical return on equity** using the **DuPont Identity**,  
2. Multiplying that by **equity value per share** to get EPS,  
3. Then multiplying EPS by a **two-year average P/E ratio** to obtain the *disaggregated price*.

*(See: DuPont Identity Explanation.)*

---

## Limitations

There are weaknesses — using historical averages doesn’t capture future changes or business model shifts.  
But that’s not the goal.  
If I wanted the most precise intrinsic values, I’d be running **5 000 DCF models a day** and never sleeping.

My goals for the screener are simple:
- Establish a **baseline understanding** of companies  
- Run **quickly**  
- **Save time** — avoid staring at 30 tickers at once  

I also wanted it to be **free** and **easy to use**, even for non-programmers.  
Thanks to **Finviz**, whose [developer API](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx) provides free access to eight quarters of financial data, this became possible.

## Implementation

Below is a summary of the key components of the screener, followed by the full Python code.

### 1. Install Dependencies

You can run this in **Google Colab** or any local Python environment:

```python
!pip install finvizfinance
"""
This code block creates the universe of companies to analyze.
In my article, I call this shortlisting. Some investors stop here,
but I believe we can go further.
"""
from finvizfinance.screener.valuation import Valuation

# Create a Valuation object
valuation = Valuation()

# Available filters include:
# 'Market Cap.', 'Debt/Equity', 'Return on Investment', etc.
filters_dict = {
    'Market Cap.': '+Mid (over $2bln)',
    'Country': 'USA',
    'Debt/Equity': 'Under 0.3',
    'Return on Investment': 'Over +20%'
}

valuation.set_filter(filters_dict=filters_dict)
df_valuation = valuation.screener_view()
df_valuation
```


```python
