# My personal Website

## Cool things about it
* It is extremely lightweight. There's minimal CSS and it's mostly just HTML.
* There is a python script that turns my .md files into HTML files. LaTeX is rendered too
* GitHub actions and pages are used in it, so that when I push a change to main, the website is deployed with the changes. This allows for CI/CD since the website will never be static.
